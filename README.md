# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Hero Section - Vibe Coder Mini Challenge

This project presents a dynamic and interactive **Hero Section**.

It simulates a real-world "AI-driven" coding experience — where you can instantly regenerate new creative content (headline, subheadline, and image) with a click, offering a glimpse into how modern web interfaces feel alive and intelligent.

## 📋 Features
- **Editable Headline and Subheadline**: Click and edit content directly (inline editing).
- **CTA Button** ("Get Started") to simulate a real call-to-action.
- **Dynamic Image** that changes along with text.
- **"Regenerate with AI" Button**: Randomly swaps content to simulate AI-powered outputs locally.
- **Smooth Animations** using `framer-motion` for seamless transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for both mobile and desktop experiences.
- **No Backend Needed**: Powered entirely by local React state for instant interactivity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** (with Vite for blazing fast setup)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for clean and responsive UI)
- **Framer Motion** (for beautiful animations)
