# Hero Section - Vibe Coder Mini Challenge

This project presents a dynamic and interactive **Hero Section**.

It simulates a real-world "AI-driven" coding experience — where you can instantly regenerate new creative content (headline, subheadline, and image) with a click, offering a glimpse into how modern web interfaces feel alive and intelligent.

## 📋 Features
- **Editable Headline and Subheadline**: Click and edit content directly (inline editing).
- **CTA Button** ("Get Started") to simulate a real call-to-action.
- **Dynamic Image** that changes along with text.
- **"Regenerate with AI" Button**: Randomly swaps content to simulate AI-powered outputs locally.
- **Smooth Animations** using `framer-motion` for seamless transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for both mobile and desktop experiences.
- **No Backend Needed**: Powered entirely by local React state for instant interactivity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** (with Vite for blazing fast setup)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for clean and responsive UI)
- **Framer Motion** (for beautiful animations)
